# Intro

# Final Summary worksheetðŸ“ˆ
Have a look at the first 3 worksheets, they contain performance scores for each barita from term 1-4. Now go to the Final Summary worksheet and use 3D-Formulas to get performance score average for 3 terms.

## Approach
- **3D-formulas:**
    ```=AVERAGE('Orders Term 1:Orders Term 4'!E4)```
- **Name Ranges:**
  * **Create from Selection** to name each of columns of data

 - **Text Functions:**
  * Use COUNTIFS to calc total number of all performance grades

- Customer Noah Chen graded barista Amy with 91 score (bolded RED)
- Number of B's achieved is 79
- Barista Amy got 13 As, 9 Bs, and none Cs

# Missed Order worksheetðŸ“ˆ
Have a look at the worksheets Missed Term 1 through to Term 4, they contain a list of dates that customers didn't pick up their beverage orders. We need to create a summary showing a count of how many days each customer missed their pickup.

## Approach
- Consolidating tool to count days of missed orders for 3 terms

## Storytelling

- 5 distinct customers didn't pick up their drinks for more than 2 orders. They are: CUST0050, 0027, 0052, 0070, and 0079.


# Customer Report worksheetðŸ“ˆ
Go to the Customer Report worksheet. Some of the information still needs to be completed. Create a formula in E4 to return the Customer's full name, this should be First Name followed by a space and then Surname. The case must also be corrected so that all words start with a capital letter but everything else is in lower case e.g., Ava Hoang
Question 9
In F4 create a formula to generate the customer email address. This should be their first initial, followed by their surname, followed by "@bbt.com", and must all be in lower case, e.g. ahoang@bbt.com. 
In G4 create a formula that will put "2015-" followed by the last three digits of the Customer ID, e.g. 2015-001.
We would like to get an idea of how baristas have progressed over the year. Create a sparkline line chart that charts the data. Change the sparkline to show the highest point. Which of these sparklines represents Olivia Jones' data?

# Approach
Use nest functions with text functions (ex: PROPER, LOWER, UPPER, ...)
- Full name: =PROPER(CONCAT(B4," ",C4))
- Email: =LOWER(CONCAT(LEFT(B4,1),C4,"@bbt.com"))
- ID: =CONCAT(2015,"-",RIGHT(A4,3))
