# ðŸ§‹ðŸ§‹INTRO
This is **Part 2** of the Bubble Tea project where I built a **quote summary and data visualization** for ```Phamily Tea House``` using advanced Excel. 

The focus here is on **Customer Quote** section, covering: 
  * **order management** (location, description, quantity)
  * **pricing calculations** 
  * uncovered key **order patterns**

Together, these perspectives demonstrate how small businesses can use data-driven tools to streamline operations, optimize pricing, and better understand their customers.

# ðŸ“‰1_VLOOKUP workbook
## ðŸ”—Link: [Advanced_Excel_boba]()

- **Purpose:** 
- **Skills Applied:**
  * **CHOOSE, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH**
  * **Data formatting** for clear presentation
  * Dynamics Lookups with **nested functions** 
  * Data Visualization using **Pivot Tables/Charts**


## ðŸ”¢Excel Formulas Applied
- **CHOOSE**: retrieving a value from a list based on a given numeric value. Useful for mapping codes to names.
  
  `=CHOOSE(index_num, value1, [value2], ...)`
  
- **VLOOKUP**: Lookup a matching value of a table, then return a corresponding value from the same row.
  
  `=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])`

- **INDEX-MATCH:** Performs dynamic lookups by row and column. More versatile than VLOOKUP.
  
  `=INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])` 

  `=MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])`

_Clustered Bar & Line showing Top 5 customers with the highest total spending_

- **Lucas Pham** and **Liam Nguyen** were the top spenders
- **Ava Kim**, despite spending less overall, placed the highest number of orders **(12)**, suggesting smaller spending but more frequent purchases.
- Spending (**Total Cost**) vs. Order Quantity (**Qty**) are **not strongly correlate**d. Some customers placed fewer orders but spent more per order.
- The pattern suggests a mix of **high-spend, low-frequency customers** (ex: Lucas Pham) and **frequent, moderate spenders** (ex: Ava Kim)


## ðŸ”ŽKey Insights
Panorama Hills generated the highest subtotal ($739.41), making it the most profitable order location.

Customers in Category D placed higher-value orders but received the largest discount ratesâ€”balancing profit and customer loyalty.

The total order value across all locations is $2,062.78, giving a benchmark for operational and pricing strategies.


Variations in drink prices, quantities, and categories highlight opportunities to optimize pricing and promotions for each region.
